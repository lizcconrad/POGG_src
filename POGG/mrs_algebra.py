class SSEMENT(mrs.MRS):
    """
    Wrapper class for the PyDelphin MRS object.
    An MRS is a tuple of the form <Hook, R, C> where...
        ... Hook is a tuple of the form <GT, Ind, Xarg> where ...
            ... GT is the top handle
            ... Index is the index
            ... Xarg is ... ? used to deal with raising/control constructions
        ... R is a bag of EPs (see the EP class for details)
        ... C is a bag of handle constraints

    However, a SSEMENT has additional information, namely the holes.
    It is a tuple of the form <Hook, Holes, Lzt, Eqs, Hcons> where ...
        ... Hook is a tuple of the form <GT, Ind, Xarg> (same as above)
        ... Holes is the list of holes, two-layer deep dict labeled per predicate in rels list
        ... Lzt is the list of SEPs (analogous to R in an MRS)
        ... Eqs is a list of equalities between variables
        ... Hcons is a bag of handle constraints
    Basically, the only thing SSEMENT has that MRS does not is Holes, so I'm creating an object that uses
    the PyDelphin MRS object and points to pieces of it, but also has Holes

    One other small addition is the LTOP, which PyDelphin does not have,
    seemingly because PyDelphin is primarily concerned with fully composed/complete MRSes,
    where the TOP is basically an "unrelated" handle that is QEQ to the LBL of the EP where ARG0=top level INDEX.
    However, during composition, the LTOP (or local top) is more appropriate
