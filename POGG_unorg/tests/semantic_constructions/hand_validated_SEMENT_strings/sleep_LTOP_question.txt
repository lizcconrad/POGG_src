... so bc the noun must be quantified and the LTOP of a quantifier (the functor, where the hook will come from) is NOT identified with its LBL,
the LBL of "run" is never identified with anything else bc LTOP is unidentified



... what about PP modifier? ... erm oh PP mods do have LBLs identified with the noun they modify teehee ok
